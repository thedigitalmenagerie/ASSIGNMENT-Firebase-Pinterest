# Pinterest

Your team has been tasked with creating pinterest.  If you live under a rock and have never used pinterest before go figure out what it does. TLDR; users create boards and can pin urls to the boards

## Requirements
* Clean code - single responsibility principle
* ES6 Modules bundled with webpack
* No errors - linters should be clean
* SASS and Bootstrap for styling
* Completely planned out - before each section you should be making new cards before you code.  You should have wireframes and an ERD

## HW Parts

### Part 2: READ

* As a user, when I click on one of my boards, I should see a single board view that shows all pins for that board.

### Part 3: DELETE
* As a user, I should be able to delete a pin from one of my boards.

* As a user, when I delete one of my boards all pins that were on that board should be deleted as well.

### Part 4: CREATE
* As a user, I should be able to create a new pin.

### Part 5: UPDATE
* As a user, I should be able to change which board a pin belongs to.

### Part 6: Deploy and Readme
* As a user I should be able to use your app on the internet - it should be deployed using Netlify.

* As a developer, I want to see an amazing README for this project.
